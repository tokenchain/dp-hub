In this section we describe the processing of the bonds messages and the corresponding updates to the state. All created/modified state objects specified by each message are defined within the [state](./02_state.md) section.

## MsgCreateBond

Bonds can be created by any address using `MsgCreateBond`.

	BatchBlocks            sdk.Uint
}
```

This message is expected to fail if:

- another bond with this token is already registered, the token is the staking token, or the token is not a valid denomination
- name or description is an empty string
- function type is not one of the defined function types (`power_function`, `sigmoid_function`, `swapper_function`)
- function parameters are negative or invalid for the selected function type:
  - Valid example for `power_function`: `"m:12,n:2,c:100"`
  - Valid example for `sigmoid_function`: `"a:3,b:5,c:1"`
  - For `swapper_function`: `""` (no parameters)
- function parameters do not satisfy the extra parameter restrictions
  - Function parameter `c` for `sigmoid_function` cannot be zero
- reserve tokens list is invalid. Valid inputs are:
  - For `swapper_function`: two valid comma-separated denominations, e.g. `res,rez`
  - Otherwise: one or more valid comma-separated denominations, e.g. `res,rez,rex`
- for `power_function` or `sigmoid_function`, reserve address is the fee address
- tx or exit fee percentage is negative
- sum of tx and exit fee percentages exceeds 100%
- for `power_function` or `sigmoid_function`, fee address is the reserve address
- order quantity limits is not one or more valid comma-separated amount
  - Valid example: `"100res,200rez"`
- max supply value is not in the bond token denomination
- sanity rate is neither an empty string nor a valid decimal
- sanity margin percentage is neither an empty string nor a valid decimal
- sanity rate is not an empty string and sanity margin percentage is an empty string (in other words, sanity rate is defined but sanity margin percentage is not)
- allow sells is not one of `"true"` or `"false"`
- signers is not one or more valid comma-separated account addresses
- any field is empty, except for order quantity limits, sanity rate, sanity margin percentage, and function parameters for `swapper_function`

This message creates and stores the `Bond` object at appropriate indexes. Note that the sanity rate and sanity margin percentage are only used in the case of the `swapper_function`, but no error is raised if these are set for other function types.

## MsgEditBond

The owner of a bond can edit some of the bond's parameters using `MsgEditBond`.

| **Field**              | **Type**           | **Description**                                                                                               |
|:-----------------------|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Token                  | `string`           | The bond to be edited |
| Name                   | `string`           | |
| Description            | `string`           | |
| FunctionType           | `string`           | |
| OrderQuantityLimits    | `sdk.Coins`        | |
| SanityRate             | `sdk.Dec`          | |
| SanityMarginPercentage | `sdk.Dec`          | |
| Editor                 | `sdk.AccAddress`   | The account address of the user editing the bond |
| Signers                | `[]sdk.AccAddress` | |

This message is expected to fail if:
- any editable field violates the restrictions set for the same field in `MsgCreateBond`
- all editable fields are `"[do-not-modify]"`
- signers list is not equal to the bond's signers list

```go
type MsgEditBond struct {
	Token                  string
	Name                   string
	Description            string
	OrderQuantityLimits    string
	SanityRate             string
	SanityMarginPercentage string
	Editor                 sdk.AccAddress
	Signers                []sdk.AccAddress
}
```

This message stores the updated `Bond` object.

## MsgBuy

Any address that holds tokens that a bond uses as its reserve can buy tokens from that bond in exchange for reserve tokens. Rather than performing the buy itself, the `MsgBuy` handler registers a buy order in the current orders batch and cancels any other orders that become unfulfillable. Any order in that batch gets fulfilled at the end of the batch's lifespan. The `MsgBuy` handler also locks away the `MaxPrices` value (`< Balance`) indicated by the address so that these are not used elsewhere whilst the batch is being processed.

A buy order is cancelled if the max prices are exceeded at any point during the lifespan of the batch. Otherwise, the buy order is fulfilled. The number of tokens requested are minted on the fly and any remaining tokens from the locked `MaxPrices`, minus the transaction fee specified by the bond, are returned to the user. The actual price in reserve tokens charged to the address is determined from the bond function, but is also influenced by any other buys and sells in the same orders batch, as a means to prevent front-running.

| **Field** | **Type**         | **Description**                                   |
|:----------|:-----------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| Buyer     | `sdk.AccAddress` | The account address of the user buying the tokens |
| Amount    | `sdk.Coin`       | The amount of bond tokens to be bought            |
| MaxPrices | `sdk.Coins`      | The max price to pay in reserve tokens            |

This message is expected to fail if:
- amount is not an amount of an existing bond
- max prices is greater than the balance of the buyer
- max prices are not amounts of the bond's reserve tokens
- denominations in max prices are not the bond's reserve tokens
- buyer does not afford to buy the tokens at the current price
- amount causes the bond's batch-adjusted current supply to exceed the max supply
- amount violates an order quantity limit defined by the bond

The batch-adjusted current supply in the case of buys is the current supply of the bond plus any uncancelled buy amounts in the current batch. 

```go
type MsgBuy struct {
	Buyer     sdk.AccAddress
	Amount    sdk.Coin
	MaxPrices sdk.Coins
}
```

This message adds the buy order to the current batch.

### MsgBuy for Swapper Function Bonds

In general, but especially in the case of swapper function bonds, buying tokens from a bond can be seen as adding liquidity to that bond's token. To add liquidity to a swapper function, the current exchange rate is used to determine how much of each reserve token makes up the price. Otherwise, the price is an equal number of each of the reserve tokens according to the function type.

Moreover, in the case of the swapper function, the first `MsgBuy` performed is special and plays a very important role in specifying the price of the bond token. Since we have no price reference for the first buy in a swapper function, the `MaxPrices` specified are used as the actual price, with no fees charged.

This effectively means that if the user requested `n` bond tokens with max prices `aR1` and `bR2` (for reserve tokens `R1` and `R2`), the next buyers will have to pay `(a/n)R1` and `(b/n)R2` tokens per bond token requested. Specifying high `a` and `b` prices for a small `n` (say `n=1`) means that the next buyers will have to pay at most `aR1` and `bR2` per bond token. **Thus, it is important that the first buy is well-calculated and performed carefully.**

## MsgSell

Any address that holds previously bought bond tokens can, at any point, sell the tokens back to the bond in exchange for reserve tokens. Similar to the `MsgBuy`, the `MsgSell` handler just registers a sell order in the current orders batch which then gets fulfilled at the end of the batch's lifespan.

Once the sell order is fulfilled, the number of tokens to be sold are burned on the fly and the address gets reserve tokens in return, minus the transaction and exit fees specified by the bond. The actual number of reserve tokens given to the address in return is determined from the bond function, but is also influenced by any other buys and sells in the same orders batch, as a means to prevent front-running. A sell order cannot be cancelled.

In general, but especially in the case of swapper function bonds, buying tokens from a bond can be seen as adding liquidity for that bond. To add liquidity to a swapper function, the current exchange rate is used to determine how much of each reserve token makes up the price. Otherwise, the price is an equal number of each of the reserve tokens according to the function type.

| **Field** | **Type**         | **Description**                                    |
|:----------|:-----------------|:---------------------------------------------------|
| Seller    | `sdk.AccAddress` | The account address of the user selling the tokens |
| Amount    | `sdk.Coin`       | The amount of bond tokens to be sold               |

This message is expected to fail if:
- amount is not an amount of an existing bond
- amount is greater than the balance of the seller
- amount is greater than the bond's current supply
- amount causes the bond's batch-adjusted current supply to become negative
- amount violates an order quantity limit defined by the bond

The batch-adjusted current supply in the case of sells is the current supply of the bond minus any uncancelled sell amounts in the current batch.

```go
type MsgSell struct {
	Seller sdk.AccAddress
	Amount sdk.Coin
}
```

This message adds the sell order to the current batch.

## MsgSwap

Any address that holds tokens (_t1_) that a swapper function bond uses as one of its two reserves (_t1_ and _t2_) can swap the tokens in exchange for reserve tokens of the other type (_t2_). Similar to the `MsgBuy` and `MsgSell`, the `MsgSwap` handler just registers a swap order in the current orders batch which then gets fulfilled at the end of the batch's lifespan.

Once the swap order is fulfilled, 

| **Field** | **Type**         | **Description**                                                                                               |
|:----------|:-----------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Swapper   | `sdk.AccAddress` | The account address of the user swapping the tokens  |
| BondToken | `string`         | The swapper function bond to use to perform the swap |
| From      | `sdk.Coin`       | The amount of reserve tokens to be swapped           |
| ToToken   | `string`         | The token denomination that will be given in return  |

This message is expected to fail if:
- bond does not exist or is not swapper function
- from amount is greater than the balance of the swapper
- from and to tokens are the same token
- from and to tokens are not the swapper function's reserve tokens
- from amount violates an order quantity limit defined by the bond

```go
type MsgSwap struct {
	Swapper   sdk.AccAddress
	BondToken string
	From      sdk.Coin
	ToToken   string
}
```

This message adds the swap order to the current batch.
